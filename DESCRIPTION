Description: An pbdR <https://pbdr.org> interface to xgboost with MPI C library.
        This package only retains main functions of xgboost but aims
        for computing performance to obtain results using distributed
        computation via pbdMPI. This package uses Single
        Program/Multiple Data ('SPMD') parallel programming style that
        is intended for batch parallel execution on clusters or HPC resources.
SystemRequirements: OpenMPI (>= 1.5.4) on Solaris, Linux, Mac, and
        FreeBSD. MS-MPI (Microsoft MPI v7.1 (SDK) and Microsoft HPC
        Pack 2012 R2 MS-MPI Redistributable Package) on Windows.
